Characterizing a listener's audio aura based on the average energy, valence, and danceability of their top 100 songs from 2018 offers a general overview of their musical preferences. Energy, valence, and danceability collectively convey the mood and vibe of the listener's music taste. For instance, high energy, positive valence, and danceability suggest an upbeat and vibrant audio aura.

However, this method has limitations in capturing the depth of a listener's preferences. Music is subjective, and an average of these metrics may oversimplify the listener's emotional range and genre diversity. The top 100 songs might not fully represent the listener's overall musical identity, potentially skewed by temporary trends or moods during a specific period.

A more representative approach could involve considering the listener's complete music history, incorporating less frequently played tracks and additional emotional dimensions. A dynamic system that adapts to changing preferences and contextual factors, such as the purpose of listening, would offer a more accurate and personalized audio aura for the listener, enhancing the depth and authenticity of the characterization.
