Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: The jump from one hundered thousand to a million was unexpectedly larger.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: One hundered thousand simulations would be sweet spot. It is really fast compared to a million but close enough to ten thousand. It is good compormise between accuracy of simulation and time usage.
