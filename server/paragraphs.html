            KUNOS Simulazioni is the award-winning software house made up of motorsport enthusiasts with the aim of providing you with the best possible virtual driving experience.
            In 2014 we released Assetto Corsa, which quickly became a fan favorite due to its realistic physics engine, accurate car models, and extensive modding community. Its successor, Assetto Corsa Competizione, was released in 2019 and focuses specifically on the SRO GT World Challenge, featuring official teams, drivers, and tracks from the series, making it the go-to software for Esports competitions.
            We are dedicated to constantly improving all aspects of our simulation games, and whether you want to drive for fun or excel in competition, this is the home to feed your sim passion.
